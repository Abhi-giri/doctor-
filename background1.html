                            sharp lines cannot be drawn to delineate specific responsibilities.<br>
                            Poolicies and procedures should not only be available in writing but updated periodically. Consultations should be readily available and the organisational relationships with realated
                            specialties should be clearly understood.

                            Surgical services are the most spectacularly visible function of the hospital. In a general hospital, all branches of the surghival services diagnostic, therapeutic and operation theatres are combinesd as one department.<br>
                            Again, the policies and procedures should be available in wirting. A "credentials committee" the equivalent of medical audit committee of medical service, must have cleat criteria regarding surgical procedures to guide it.<br>
                            All case records, including laboratory reports and consent to surgery must be complete prior to operation. The tissue removed at operations must be sent for pathology and the report available in patient's record.<br><br>

                            Obstetrical services are also organised like other department with policies and procedures peculiar to its requirement. Qualified staff should be available even off-time with availability of consultants for complicated cases.<br>
                            Deliveries conducted and records maintained. There should be a system to investigate all maternal and infant deaths.
                            <br>
                            Maternal death rate (ration of maternal deaths to obsterical discharges) in good hospitals does not exceed 0.25 per cent. Some infant deaths should not excedd 3 per cent of all births.<br><br>

                            Anesthesiology service is the least visible service in a hospital, but as important as others. Apart from the high professional knowledge and skill of the anesthesiologists, the service should conform to all the standing policies and procedures.<br>
                            There must be a preanaesthetic physical checkup including relevant urine and blood examinations.

                        Safely in operation theatres is normally assingned to anesthesiology sservice. Standing order on saftey regulations must be available and enforced. deaths indirectly attributable to anesthesia should but exceed one death in 5000 anesthesia's.<br><br>
